#+title: Triplet SRC /A little TLC for all/

A Systems Research Centre[fn:1] where the triplet of Types, Logic and Categories are put first and foremost.

We hope to see how [[https://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/the-holy-trinity/][computational trinitarianism]] is generalised in light of [[http://homotopytypetheory.org/][Homotopy Type Theory]]. We're told that the triplet Types+Logic+Categories generalises to Types+Topologic+Topos.

Whether you're a programmer, logician or mathematician, we have some TLC for you: Types, Logic and Categories---generalised for all!

We hope to build a programming language and principled software systems based on this foundation.

[fn:1] Named in homage to the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Systems_Research_Center][DEC SRC]].
